well-driver
===========

Development repository for a driver for the Wellspring touchpad mouse
for FreeBSD.  This repository exists to support development and
testing of the driver prior to its inclusion into the main FreeBSD
repository.

At present, I'm getting USB DMA errors on attach.  I'm using the
existing Linux driver to figure out the device's protocol.
